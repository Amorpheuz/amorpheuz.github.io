# aboutMe

Hey Visitor!👋 My name is Yash Dave, a Front-end developer and a budding Data Science Enthusiast from the town of Vadodara, Gujarat, India. Creating websites that look beautiful and are performant is my passion, and ensuring they are accessible is my mission! 

I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Applications with Data Science at Symbiosis Internation University. I am also currently intrigued by Blockchain & Smart Contracts, and the possibilities they can help realize.

I love working with Open Source Tech while also contributing to them. I am a proud Mozillian, part of Mozilla Gujarat, and contribute to the DEV Community frequently. Encouraging and helping beginners contribute to Open Source is one of my favorite past-times.
