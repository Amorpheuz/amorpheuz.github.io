There is a smokescreen here that lies over here. Middlemen keep crops in deep freezers and release them at a high rate when demand rises. We eradicate this problem with the help of a Blockchain network and an all transparent transaction that can be monitored and stop illegal storages of vegetables/crops.

In order to solve this problem, we contacted Matic Team and we were constantly in touch with them and they helped us a lot in solving our doubts.
